# @iammati/credsman.io

Credsman.io is an open-source, easy and modern password manager.

## Why?

Since products like iPassword or NordPass are SaaS, Credsman.io is and will be always a free solution compared to those + open-source.
Another reason why to use Credsman.io over an existing open-source solution like BitWarden or whatsoever is that it looks way better than that, yet way more lightweight and easier to maintain.
